      <p><h2>Paradise Roasters</h2>
      <h5>Paradise Roasters by Mama Cata Mokkita</h5></p>
      <img src="https://jooinn.com/images/heart-coffee-4.jpg">
      <p><b>Blind Assessment:</b> Aromatically other-worldly, resoundingly juicy. Caramelized pineapple, aromatic orchid, pistachio, raw chocolate, oolong tea in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory-tart structure with gently bright acidity; deep, syrupy mouthfeel. Flavor-laden finish with especially impressive fruit and florals.</p>

      <p><b>Notes:</b> This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 1 coffee on Coffee Review‚Äôs list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2021. Produced by the Garrido family of Mama Cata farm entirely of the very rare Mokkita variety of Arabica, and processed by a particularly meticulous version of the dried-in-the-fruit natural method. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. Paradise prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed.</p>

      <p><b>The Bottom Line: </b>An opulent rendition of the rare Mokkita variety of Arabica, both sophisticated and a bit wild, with layer upon layer of tropical fruit notes ensconced in florals and chocolate ‚Äî an extraordinary sensory journey.</p>

      <h5>Barrington Coffee Roasting Testi Ayla Double Ethiopia</h5></p>
      <img src="http://wallsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Coffee-High-Definition-Wallpapers.jpg">
      <p><b>Blind Assessment:</b> High-toned, floral-driven, lyrically sweet. Wisteria, Keemun tea, white nectarine, fresh-cut basil, pink peppercorn in aroma and cup. Impeccably crystalline, balanced structure with buoyant acidity; delicately satiny mouthfeel. Very long, integrated, satisfying finish, with fruit and floral notes singing into the long.</p>

      <p><b>Notes:</b> This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 2 coffee on Coffee Review‚Äôs list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2021. Produced by Faysel Yonis entirely of the Kurume variety of Arabica and processed by the anaerobic washed method (fermentation occurs in a hermetically sealed vessel). Barrington Coffee is an artisan roaster dedicated to elite coffees, fresh delivery and roasting that foregrounds the coffee and not the roast. </p>

      <p><b>The Bottom Line: </b>An elegant, exquisitely balanced single-variety Ethiopia cup fermented anaerobically, then double-washed, for a pure expression of flowers and fruit.</p>
