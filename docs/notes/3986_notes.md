### URI syntax:
> The generic URI syntax consists of a hierarchical sequence of components referred to as the scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment.

	URI	= scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

		scheme      = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." )
		hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty
					/ path-absolute
					/ path-rootless
					/ path-empty.  
			authority   = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
				userinfo    = *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" )
				host        = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name
				port        = *DIGIT
		query       = *( pchar / "/" / "?" )
		fragment    = *( pchar / "/" / "?" )



The following are two example URIs and their component parts:

		foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
		\_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
         |           |            |            |        |
      scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
         |   _____________________|__
		/ \ /                        \
		urn:example:animal:ferret:nose

### URI path parsing:
>  If a URI contains an authority component, then the path component must either be empty or begin with a slash ("/") character.  
	If a URI does not contain an authority component, then the path cannot begin with two slash characters ("//").  
	In addition, a URI reference (Section 4.1) may be a relative-path reference, in which case the first path segment cannot contain a colon (":") character.  
	The ABNF requires five separate rules to disambiguate these cases, only one of which will match the path substring within a given URI reference.  


Rules:   

    path	= path-abempty    ; begins with "/" or is empty
			/ path-absolute   ; begins with "/" but not "//"
			/ path-noscheme   ; begins with a non-colon segment
			/ path-rootless   ; begins with a segment
			/ path-empty      ; zero characters.  
	
	segment       = *pchar
	pchar         = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@"

### Percent-Encoding:
>  [...] used to represent a data octet in a component when that octet's corresponding character is outside the allowed set or is being used as a delimiter of, or within, the component.  

	pct-encoded = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG  

> The uppercase hexadecimal digits 'A' through 'F' are equivalent to the lowercase digits 'a'  through 'f', respectively.  If two URIs differ only in the case of hexadecimal digits used in percent-encoded octets, they are equivalent.  For consistency, URI producers and normalizers should use uppercase hexadecimal digits for all percent- encodings.

### Parsing URI with regex:
> The following line is the regular expression for breaking-down a well-formed URI reference into its components.  

		^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?
    	 12            3  4          5       6  7        8 9 .  

> The numbers in the second line [...] indicate the reference points for each subexpression (i.e., each paired parenthesis).
